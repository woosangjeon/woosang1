      <h1>Biography</h1>
      <p>
        Woosang Jeon is a performer, choreographer, and performance director based in Berlin, Germany. He graduated from the Korea National
        University of Arts (K-ARTS) in Seoul, completing both his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Dance. During his academic training, he
        focused on contemporary dance technique and choreography, while also researching and exploring concepts of performativity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Upon graduation, Woosang immediately began his professional career as a dancer with LDP Company in 2017, establishing his presence in
      the Korean dance scene. In 2018, he expanded his career by joining the Korea National Dance Company as a choreography assistant,
      contributing to the project Man Made. His independent works gained international recognition early on, with his creation Lost Room
      being invited to the MASDANZA Festival in Gran Canaria and Bratislava in Movement in Slovakia in 2017.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2020, Woosang moved to Berlin, where he performed in Beautiful Landscapes by Kosmas Kosmopoulos / LUNA PARK and Big Boys Don't Cry…
      But When They Do? by Marion Sparber. His collaborations with Marion Sparber and Alan Fuentes Guerra led to performances in four of
      Sparber's productions, touring Germany, Italy, and Austria, including appearances at prestigious festivals such as Alps Move, Ulm
      Moves, and Lurupina Zirkus.
    </p>

    <p>
      In early 2021, Woosang co-founded gameisalreadyset, a multidisciplinary art collective based at Artist-Homes Berlin, where he actively
      works as a performance director and choreographer. The collective's debut project was presented in two screenings, further expanding
      its artistic reach. Throughout 2021, Woosang also performed in The Urge by Ceren Oran, Tanz in Oberaudorf by Jasmine Ellis, and
      Onomatopoeia.
    </p>

    <p>
      Woosang continued his international journey in 2022, performing in Collective Behavior — a co-production between the artist collective
      Kimchi and Chips and Danish choreographer Simone Wierød, with performances in Korea. Upon returning to Germany, he created and
      performed in AniBody by Seunghwan Lee, showcased at Choreographisches Centrum Heidelberg, Theater Felina Mannheim, and LAB Mannheim.
      He also joined Eric Trottier's team for Us at Eintanzhaus Mannheim and Tanzlabor Ulm.
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of gameisalreadyset, Woosang collaborated with Wonjune Choi as performance director for PARASIGHTseeing, a project produced by
      Frederik Britzlmair and Jasmin Halama in Berlin. In January 2023, Woosang participated as a guest artist at a gallery opening at Molt
      in Berlin, marking another milestone in his expanding artistic network.
    </p>

    <p>
      As of 2024, Woosang Jeon became a full-time member of the internationally renowned dance and theatre company CONSTANZA MACRAS / DORKY
      PARK, where he continues to contribute his creative talents and performance expertise to the company's groundbreaking productions.
      This collaboration represents a significant milestone in his career, aligning him with one of the most innovative and established
      companies in the international dance and theatre world.
